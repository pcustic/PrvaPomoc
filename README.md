# Prva pomoc
Android app that saves lives!

Prva pomoć is Android application that is meant to be an assistant in providing first aid in emergency situation.

App guides you through whole procedure of providing first aid: situation assessment, consciousness and breathing check, 
putting someone in recovery position and secondary diagnosis. It also gives you text, visual and audio instructions.

It is not meant to be a handbook from which you would learn first aid procedures but rather an assistant in stressful emergency situations.

App was made by Vesna Magjarević and me with the official support from Croatian Red Cross. It was a part of App Start Contest 2017.
